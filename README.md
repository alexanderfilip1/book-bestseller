# Book Besteller App on React

In this application, I created a React component-based structure to display Amazon Best Sellers Books. I defined a Books component that holds an array of book data, including author, title, image, and ID. This component maps over the book data and renders a list of Book components, each displaying the book's image, title, author, and a numbered ranking.
